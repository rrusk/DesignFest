# ResearchKit - Healthkit - Carekit Scenarios
03-Aug-2016 


## Purpose:

To outline several scenarios to help guide the review of these platforms for research in the lab.



## PROs 1

Patient reported outcomes are an area of interest. These are patient answered questions that can be used to assess

The EQ5D is a simple validated PRO tool that includes six questions. There are five questions about different areas of function. There is one summary question. We are considering using the EQ5D 5L and have a licence for academic purposes. http://www.euroqol.org

Explore the ability to include the full EQ5D 5L as an "app" on an iPhone / iPod and iPad.

Then consider how we can look at population level analysis that includes:

1. Population averages for each question, averaging within patient first, then across patients. Explore reporting and graphing capabilities
2. Examining within person trending of multiple scores of the EQ5D from the same person over time (e.g. daily or weekly data).


## PROs 2

PROMIS http://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis is a larger data set of PROs. There are multiple PRO instruments within the PROMIS set that can be related to each other.

Explore how we can have screening questions that, when a specific answer is completed, trigger more in depth set of questions.

## Other Aspects

Also, some of the other aspects to think about describing back to us are the non-functional functions related to security etc
